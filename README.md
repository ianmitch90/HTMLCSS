# The Goal :sparkles:

Really this is just to view, hopefully it serves you as an example of how to design websites and web applications.

Here I focus on one CSS property and use it in various layout incarnations.

That property:  :hover

# CSS is Hard :sob: :sob: :sob:

##However it gets better.... i promise

This is broken up in diffrent pages to highlight advantages of layout and design:

1. HOME - Here is a combination of all techniques you will see though out the project

2. GRID - CSS Grids make layouts a breeze, here i show how easy it is to visualize how layer by layer how css grids can be used and how you might not even have to use a media query!

3. FLEX - Flex Box was how we made layouts a breeze before CSS grids came along. it follows the box model and here i have resources available on the live version for you to explore.

4. BOOT - Not a Designer? It's ok! Every Designer has a way of thinking about how the internet should look and feel. Lucky for you Twitter became popular making their own Library and Design pattern that makes design a breeze! on this page explore funimentals of design and other design patterns/libraries.

5. FLOAT - "Back in my day..... you only had float!" the float property in css is the cornerstone of forcing things where you want them to be! Don't have access to the other fancy Grids, Templates, Flex, blah blah? you can still make breathtaking experiences using plain good ol' fashion css.
